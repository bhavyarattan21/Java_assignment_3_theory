Problem Statement:

Design and implement a studentresult management system that collects
student details and their subject marks, calculates results, and displays them.
The system must handle various typesoferrorsand exceptions such as invalid
marks, null values, input mismatches, and missing data. The application should
demonstrate exception handling in Java, includinguseofbuilt-inexceptions,
customexceptions,try- catch blocks, throw, throws, and finally clauses.

ProjectObjectives:

• Understandand implement Javaexceptionhandling.

• Classifyexceptions into checkedand unchecked
types.

• Practicedeclaringand throwingexceptionsusingthrow and throws.

• Design anduse custom exception classesfordomain- specific
validation.

• Utilize try-catch-finally blocksforrobustprogram execution.

Learning Outcomes:

• Identifyandhandle runtimeerrorsusingexception handling.

• Distinguishbetweencheckedand unchecked exceptions
in Java.

• Write clean,modular code thathandlesexceptions gracefully.
• Develop real-world Java applicationsusing robusterror- handling logic.
